The main purpose of the GUI4GA software is to create a toolkit for users who use GAs. 

The GUI4GA software consists of;
a) 2 basic functions (Run and Export) that can be accessed from the callbacks section in MATLAB
b) an initialization section where the parameter values are determined
c) a section showing how to perform the optimization method
d) an information section indicating what the name of the fitness function should be
e) a section containing the selection methods
f) a section showing the results.

To use this software, you must first have a fitness function, such as the one in the example, that takes the population as input and returns the result for each individual as a matrix.

After running the software, parameter values ​​must be entered, the relevant optimization method must be selected, and the software must be run by deciding on one of the selection methods.

It should be noted that the results obtained can be exported.

Please cite GUI4GA if it has been used for academic purposes.
